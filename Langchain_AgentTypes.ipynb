In this article, we examine eight of the most impactful recent artificial intelligence developments. These range from cutting-edge solutions enhancing [...] The rise of generative AI chatbots has defined the artificial intelligence landscape since late 2022, and they continue to grow more capable. OpenAI’s ChatGPT led the wave, showing how AI can hold human-like conversations and assist with complex tasks. Since its debut, competing chatbots from Google (Gemini) and Anthropic (Claude) have entered the scene, alongside many open-source models from the research community. These systems are rapidly improving with new features like long-term memory and [...] AI developments are advancing at breakneck speed, with new breakthroughs and applications emerging almost daily. Experts only a couple of years ago predicted that we’d soon be discussing artificial intelligence capabilities that seemed unthinkable at the time – a prediction that has proven true.
